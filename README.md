## Background
Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
In this new era of generation, the numbers of people shopping online has increased significantly throughout the year which give greater impact to the business world. According to Magee (2003), the growth in the number of online shoppers is greater than the growth in Internet users, indicating that more Internet users are becoming comfortable to shop online. This whole new phenomenon of purchasing online kept on increasing due to the existence of the internet that trigger the users to choose the online shopping medium to purchase their items. The Internet, as a mean for both firms and individuals to conduct business, is nowadays one of the most widely used non-store formats (Saprikis, Chouliara and Vlachopoulou, 2010).
From the customer’s point of view, the Internet (Mehta & Sivadas, 1995) offered the potential advantages of reducing shopping time and money spent. It allowed twenty-four hours a day access, provided perhaps better service, and gave the consumer a perception of control over the shopping experience. The two most commonly cited reasons for online shopping have been convenience and price (Chen and Chang, 2003). 
The capability of purchasing without leaving your place is of great interest to many consumers. Online shopping permits the consumer to buy or to purchase online at anytime and anywhere as long as they are connected to the internet. Online shopping activities have portray several benefits that could attract online consumer to keep on purchasing online. The potential benefits of online shopping for consumers include convenience, various selection, low price, original services, personal attention, and easy access to information, among others (Lina, Liwei and Dongsong).
According to Lee and Turban (2001), there is an enormous potential in the use of Internet for the purchase of goods and services but many users are reluctant to make purchases on the Internet. Consumer hesitate to purchase online as they think that online shopping have greater risk involved as they can only depend on what they see on their screen rather than traditional shopping they could get to touch and see the physical goods itself. Not only this, some other issues that prevent consumer from online shopping is the fear of being cheated, the unsecure payment issues, informational privacy concerns and lack of trust in online shopping  system.

## What is my personal motivation?
* The history of ecommerce started over 40 years ago, when the introduction of early technology like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and teleshopping in the 1970s paved the way for the modern-day ecommerce store as we know it today. 
The history of ecommerce is closely intertwined with the history of the internet. Online shopping became possible when the internet was opened to the public in 1991. Amazon was one of the first ecommerce sites in the US to start selling products online and thousands of businesses have followed since. 
Online store was invented in 1979 and since then the internet has been a market place where the world can shop online and ship to their destination.
* first, what is an online store and shipment?
It means going online, landing on a seller's website, selecting something, and arranging for its delivery. The buyer either pays for the good or service online with a credit or debit card or upon delivery.
* the motivation include finding the best price, searching for product promotions, online shopping convenience, stimulation from the interaction with the websites, receiving personalized services, quality of the received services, perceived value, information availability.

## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
• Fruads in online shopping: Fraud in online shopping is the biggest disadvantage of online shopping.  Many people are attracted by great offers which seem too good to be true.
• Delay in the delivery: In case of offline shopping, you can receive the product then and there. But, this does not happen in online shopping. Even though it hardly takes 10-15 minutes to buy the product online, by the time it reaches your hands, it would be more than 4-5 days.
• you can't touch the product: Indians are good at bargaining. You can bargain only in case of offline shopping, not in the case of online shopping. In online shopping, you get cashbacks, discounts, and coupons, but this is not the same as bargaining. Trust me if one is good at bargaining, he can save a lot of money during offline shopping.
• hidden cost and shipment service: When you first see the product on a portal, it generally looks cheaper. But when you proceed for the payment, the extra charges like shipping charges, tax and packing charges are added.  These charges will make the product expensive vis-a-vis the local store.  
• lack of interaction: In case of offline shopping, sales assistants shower personal attention on customers and give complete details on the product. If you have any queries, you can ask right there. But, this does not happen in the case of online shopping. All you can do is see the picture and read the description. Some portals allow shoppers check the customer reviews.
• Returning the product: There is an option to return the product, if you do not like it. But again, it is a big headache. The return policy differs from one company to other. In case of some online shopping portals, customers have to bear the cost of returning the product. If you return the product, you will not be paid shipping charges which you had paid earlier. If you are shopping for cosmetics like a lipstick, they can't be returned.

* Ethical consideration to taken:
• Do a good research before before shopping.
• Must be patient because most online store take days for delivery.
• product that you can't touch must be well evaluated before purchase.
• understand the cast of product and shipment.

## What next?
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
• My Project can grow into something more using the basic tools to generate traffic online using all the social media means of advertising and creating awareness.

## What kind of skills, assistance do I need to move on?
• Bring Traffic to Your Store:
Now that you have launched your online store, it’s time to bring in some sales. The main way to do that is to bring more traffic to your store. When you have a brick-and-mortar store, you benefit from foot traffic and passersby; with an online store, you must help customers find you.
• Improve the On-Site Customer Experience:
Once you generate traffic to your store, make it easy for customers to find what they are looking for and buy it. You can quickly tell if something isn’t adding up by checking your analytics. If your reports show a high number of people visiting your site and leaving without buying, your customer experience may be the reason.
• Optimize for Conversions:
Now that you have generated store traffic and improved your site’s navigation and product visibility, it’s time to make sure sales conversions happen. Shopping statistics show that shipping, additional fees, and taxes are the significant causes of shopping cart abandonment.
• Update Inventory Frequently:
Once you gain traction with sales, the next thing you need to be mindful of is keeping the right amount of inventory on hand. You want to organize inventory so that you can maintain products at levels that meet demand without over-purchasing—and to do that, you’d need a solid inventory management plan.
• Have a Customer Retention Strategy:
We’ve heard it before; it is less expensive to retain a customer than acquire a new one. Bain & Company and Harvard Business School have found that “increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%.”
• Streamline Your Fulfillment Operations:
Part of your online store’s growth is streamlining your fulfillment operations. You might need to consider going with a fulfillment center if you can no longer handle fulfilling orders for your customers (such as handling, packing, and shipping). Orient yourselves with order fulfillment costs and weigh whether fulfilling orders in-house or through a fulfillment center is better for your ecommerce operations.
• Provide Excellent Customer Service:
According to HubSpot research, 93% of customers are likely to make repeat purchases with companies that offer excellent customer service. Excellent customer support is key to retention, brand advocacy and, eventually, more growth.
• Bottom Line:
To successfully grow and sustain ecommerce business, you need to develop both short- and long-term plans. These involve incorporating analytics, crafting marketing strategies, improving and streamlining operations, enhancing your buyer’s shopping experience, and focusing on delivering excellent and prompt customer support.
